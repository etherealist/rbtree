rbtree
======

My rbtree code is really good. I developed it for chirp, a project I burned out
over. Chirp was good too, but I don't go back there anymore, too much damage was
done.

I had my quite egocentric code-formatting back then. So I run `rbtree.h` and
`qs.h` through clang format. I also removed all mention of chirp and some other
crazy ideas I had back then.

* `rbtree.h` is now a humble red-black tree implementation
* `qs.h` is a humble queue, stack and ring implementation
* performance is very well and it should be very readable and good for learning
